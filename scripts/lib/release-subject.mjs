/**
 * Is this commit subject a RELEASE, rather than something a release contains?
 * (#1309)
 *
 * Three shapes, and the third is the one this repo produces on EVERY release —
 * `npm version patch -m "chore(release): %s"`, squash-merged with the PR number
 * appended by GitHub:
 *
 *   release: v0.50.87 — …            a hand-written release PR
 *   0.50.85 (#1302)                  a bare version subject
 *   chore(release): 0.50.85 (#1302)  what the release flow actually writes
 *   chore: release v0.52.133 (#2381) what the release PR is TITLED (#2407)
 *
 * Only the first two were matched, so every release-reconcile commit fell
 * through to the conventional-commit parser, was read as a `chore` with scope
 * `release`, and appeared in the NEXT release's entry under "Changed".
 *
 * Nothing else caught it: the de-duplication that makes the deliberately-wide
 * commit range safe is "filter out PRs the changelog already documents", and a
 * release-reconcile PR is never documented — it is not a change.
 *
 * TWO CONSTRAINTS, and the second was a codex finding. Scope alone is not
 * enough: `fix(release): prevent failed releases from corrupting user installs`
 * is scoped `release` and is a REAL user-facing change. Matching on scope alone
 * would have silently dropped it — the exact failure this generator warns about
 * at length, introduced while fixing a different one. So a release-scoped
 * subject must ALSO carry nothing but a version (plus the PR number GitHub
 * appends), which is what the release flow produces and what a fix to the
 * release process never does.
 *
 * And deliberately NOT a blanket `chore:` skip, for the same reason in the other
 * direction: an ordinary chore can be user-facing.
 *
 * Lives in its own module so it can be tested directly. An earlier attempt tested
 * it through the generator against a scratch repo and the test passed with the fix
 * REVERTED — the synthetic history dropped the entry for an unrelated reason, so
 * it was verifying nothing.
 *
 * The FOURTH shape was found by #2407 while porting the panel's changelog guard.
 * Protected main takes the release through a pull request, and that PR is titled
 * `chore: release v0.52.133` — no `(release)` scope, the version in the BODY. It
 * is the shape the last six releases actually landed with, and none of the three
 * regexes above sees it. The generator never noticed because a release commit is
 * created by `npm version` AFTER gen-changelog has already run, and the tag then
 * sits on that commit, so it falls outside the next release's range too. The
 * guard does see it — `v<prev>..v<X>` is inclusive of X's own release commit —
 * and would have reported every release as missing an entry for itself.
