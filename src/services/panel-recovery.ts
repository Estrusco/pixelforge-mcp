// NEVER LEAVE THE CALLER WITH ONLY A TOOL THEY CANNOT INVOKE. (#774, #784)
//
// When the bridge refuses a graph WRITE because the connected panel is too old
// to fence the command against the active workflow (#718), the refusal has
// always ended with "Run install_comfyui(action:'panel', panel_action:'update')". In a local session
// with a resolvable ComfyUI that is exactly right. In the two sessions that
// filed #774 and #784 it is a dead end:
//
//  - REMOTE/CLOUD (#774): install_comfyui(action:'panel') is deliberately local-only. It answers
//    `decision: "not-applicable"` and changes nothing, because the panel lives
//    on someone else's filesystem. panel_update_node then refuses too — it
//    cannot verify an on-disk move (#639/#641) — and points BACK at
//    install_comfyui(action:'panel'). Two tools, one circle, no way out.
//
//  - EMBEDDED PANEL SESSION (#784): the sidebar surface is the disjoint
//    `panel_*` tool set. install_comfyui(action:'panel') was never in it, so the recommendation
//    named a tool that was not merely unhelpful but absent.
//
// A hard version gate is only defensible while its escape hatch works. So the
// recovery text is built HERE, from the session's actual context, under two
// rules:
//
//  1. Where install_comfyui(action:'panel') provably CANNOT do the job — remote, cloud, or a
//     local install we have positively determined does not exist — it is not
//     named at all. The text gives the commands to run on the ComfyUI host.
//
//  2. Where it can, it is named AND the host-side commands are given as the
//     alternative, because whether install_comfyui(action:'panel') is actually in the caller's
//     advertised tool set is a property of the client's surface, not of this
//     process, and is therefore not knowable from here. Offering both costs a
//     sentence and removes the only way this message can dead-end.
//
// Note what is deliberately NOT done: nothing here weakens the write gate. The
// panel still cannot make an unfenced write. This module only fixes the remedy.
//
// It is the SINGLE source of that advice — the bridge refusal, the install_comfyui(action:'panel')
// status note, the sync assessment and panel_update_node's refusal all render
// it, so they cannot drift apart and contradict each other.

 * A tab holding that file from before 0.11.35 therefore announces the OLD

 *
 * WHY THE TAB IS OLD is a separate question from the fact that it is, and panel

    //    older stays open, so the text names the ordinary reason (the pack moved
    //    under an open tab) without asserting a mechanism it did not observe.

    //    must be named rather than left to be discovered after the reload fails.
    // RELOAD FIRST, HARD-REFRESH AS THE ESCALATION (panel #1515).

    // /extensions/ path — ours and other packs' alike — so the HTTP cache is not
    // the mechanism there", and the pack installs a no-store backstop for hosts
    // that set none. On any current host an ordinary reload DOES pick up new JS.
    //
    // Leading with the cache therefore named a cause that no longer applies and
    // buried the one that does — a tab that has simply been open since before the
    // pack changed. #1515's reporter had an in-place ComfyUI-Manager update at
    // 11:37 on a tab opened at 11:11, with no restart and no reload; they were
