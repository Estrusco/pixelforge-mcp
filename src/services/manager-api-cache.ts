// ComfyUI-Manager API dialect cache (issue #646)
//
// detectManagerApi() (services/node-management.ts) probes the connected ComfyUI
// once and classifies its Manager into one of three wire dialects. Probing on
// every operation would add 1-3 round trips to every Manager call, so the result
// is cached — but it used to be cached for the WHOLE PROCESS LIFETIME, keyed
// only by the base URL.
//
// A ComfyUI restart at the SAME base URL can change the dialect underneath us:
// upgrading the 3.x custom-node Manager to pip comfyui_manager 4.x, or dropping
// --enable-manager-legacy-ui, keeps the URL identical while flipping which
// endpoints exist. The URL-keyed lifetime cache then routes every subsequent
// Manager call through the PREVIOUS server's endpoints — download_model kept
// speaking the v2-batch/legacy-UI dialect to a normal Manager 4.2.2 and failed
// with a legacy-UI arbitrary-URL rejection forever (#646).
//
// This module is the single owner of that cached classification, so the two
// self-healing mechanisms live in one place:
//
//   1. EXPLICIT INVALIDATION on the restart lifecycle the repo already has.
//      Every place that drops the memoized /object_info because ComfyUI is
//      being restarted (services/process-control.ts stop/restart/Manager-reboot,
//      the panel's restart tools) also drops the dialect — same signal, same
//      reason: what the live server exposes may have just changed.
//
//   2. A TTL BACKSTOP for the OUT-OF-BAND restart — the #646 report's actual
//      path: the user upgraded Manager and restarted ComfyUI themselves, so no
//      mcp tool ever ran and no explicit invalidation fired. This mirrors the
//      /object_info TTL added for the same class of bug in #528: within the
//      window calls are served from cache (no extra probes on the hot path), and
//      the first call after the window re-probes and picks up whatever the live
//      server now is. Manager exposes no boot id / generation counter, so a TTL
//      is the lightest self-healing mechanism available.
//
// Deliberately kept in its own leaf module (logger-only imports) so the restart
// paths can invalidate the dialect without importing the heavyweight
// node-management unit (comfy-cli subprocesses, git helpers, …).
