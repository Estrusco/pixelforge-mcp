/**
 * txt2img capability probing for checkpoint auto-select (issue #892).
 *
 * `generate_image`'s auto-select used to take the alphabetically-first entry
 * of the checkpoints listing — which fails 100% of the time when that entry
 * is a video model (LTX, Wan, HunyuanVideo), because the txt2img graph wires
 * CheckpointLoaderSimple's CLIP output into CLIPTextEncode and a video
 * checkpoint contains no text encoder weights (clip arrives as None).
 *
 * ComfyUI exposes no "does this checkpoint contain a CLIP" endpoint, so the
 * probe reads the safetensors header (first bytes only, never the multi-GB
 * tensor payload). A header WITH known text-encoder tensor prefixes is
 * "capable"; a header with a recognized diffusion/VAE layout but no text
 * encoder is "incapable" (an observed absence, e.g. the video models this
 * fix targets); anything else — remote servers, non-safetensors formats,
 * unreadable files, unrecognized layouts — is "unknown", never folded into
 * "incapable". Selection prefers known-capable, falls back to unknown, and
 * refuses only when EVERY candidate is known incapable (where enqueueing
 * would be a guaranteed CLIPTextEncode failure).
