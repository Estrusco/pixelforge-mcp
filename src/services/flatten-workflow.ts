// In-place workflow flattener: resolve virtual wiring — rgthree/KJ Get/Set
// buses, Reroutes, and cg-use-everywhere (UE) broadcast links — into direct
// real links on the ORIGINAL UI graph, deleting the now-dead virtual nodes.
//
// This deliberately does NOT round-trip through the API converter
// (convertUiToApi → convertApiToUi): that regenerates the layout and throws
// away everything the author arranged. Litegraph groups are geometric (a
// titled bounding box — no node membership), so by never moving a kept node,
// positions/sizes/colors/groups/titles are preserved for free; the only
// visible change is the deleted virtual nodes leaving empty space.
//
// UE resolution strategy (see docs in the panel_flatten_workflow tool):
//   1. `extra.ue_links` — cg-use-everywhere writes its computed broadcast
//      links there on every graph analysis, as objects
//      { downstream, downstream_slot, upstream, upstream_slot, controller, type }
//      where `upstream` is already the REAL producer (for Seed Everywhere the
//      controller IS the producer — it owns the seed widget). Materializing
//      these is the pack's own ground truth: zero re-implementation.
//   2. If UE sender nodes exist but ue_links is absent/stale → warn and leave
//      those senders in place (never guess a broadcast match).
//
// Unlike the API converter, the resolver here stops at ANY real node
// regardless of mode: muted/bypassed toggle branches are the author's state
// and a wiring-only flatten must not collapse or drop them.
