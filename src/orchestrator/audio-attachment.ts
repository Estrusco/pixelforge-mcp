// Audio attachments on an agent turn (issue #790).
//
// Before this module the agent could DRIVE ComfyUI's audio tools but never HEAR
// anything: every backend attached only image content parts, so an audio file
// either never left the orchestrator or (worse) was handed to a vision part and
// silently ignored. This module owns the two things that must never be guessed:
//
//   1. WHICH bytes are audio we can actually deliver (mime + non-empty + size).
//   2. WHAT the user is told when we cannot deliver them.
//
// The governing rule for (2): a SILENTLY dropped attachment is the worst
// outcome. The user asks about a sound, the model answers from the text alone,
// and nothing in the transcript reveals it never heard it. So every path here
// ends in either "delivered" or a refusal the user reads verbatim, and every
// refusal names something that WOULD work from where the caller is standing.
//
// Wire formats (both live-verified against Ollama on 2026-08-04, gemma4:e2b —
// see docs/local-llms.mdx):
//   • Ollama native  POST /api/chat            → message.images[] (raw base64).
//     Ollama's own /v1/audio/transcriptions middleware does exactly this
//     (openai/openai.go FromTranscriptionRequest puts AudioData in Images), so
//     `images` is really "binary multimodal attachments", not strictly images.
//   • OpenAI dialect POST /v1/chat/completions → {type:"input_audio",
//     input_audio:{data,format}}. NOTE an audio data-URL in an `image_url` part
//     is a hard 400 ("invalid image input") — audio must never ride that part.
//
// NOT shipped: ACP (Gemini/Grok CLI) session/prompt does define an audio
// ContentBlock, but it requires the agent to advertise an `audio` prompt
// capability first and neither CLI has been observed doing so — an unexercisable
// send path whose failure mode is an unheard attachment is the overclaim this
// module exists to remove. Those backends declare `audio: false` instead.
