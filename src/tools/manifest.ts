LOCAL ComfyUI: model downloads use the connected server's live/data model roots; pip uses the serving checkout (live main.py root, then COMFYUI_CODE_PATH, then COMFYUI_PATH); filesystem custom-node fallbacks use the live data/base root (live --base-directory, then COMFYUI_PATH). REMOTE ComfyUI: custom_nodes and models are routed through the ComfyUI-Manager HTTP API (handled on the host), while pip and apt entries are reported as skipped (no remote equivalent). Each item reports applied/skipped/failed/pending independently. success is true only when nothing failed AND nothing is still pending. A PARTIAL INSTALL (custom_nodes left unsubmitted when the time budget elapsed) is named in the partial field — a drained Manager queue / panel_node_queue_status does not include those entries; re-run apply_manifest to submit them. Do not restart ComfyUI until they report applied or skipped.",
