/**
 * `generate_image (action:"audio")` — the handler the standalone audio tool
 * used to carry (0.50.0 slice 16), unchanged apart from losing its own
 * registration.
 *
 * The service call, its deps and the returned JSON (status/model_family/
 * prompt_id/queue_remaining/note) are identical. The try/catch moved OUT to the
 * dispatcher in generate-image.ts, which applies the same `errorToToolResult`.
 * The args object is built FIELD BY FIELD rather than spread from the shared
 * flat schema, so no parameter belonging to another action can reach this
 * service.
