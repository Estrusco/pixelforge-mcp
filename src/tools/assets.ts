/**
 * `generate_image (action:"regenerate")` — the handler the standalone
 * re-enqueue-an-asset tool used to carry (0.50.0 slice 16), unchanged apart from
 * losing its own registration.
 *
 * 0.50.0 slice 15 emptied the rest of this module: the inline viewer, the
 * registry listing and the provenance reader became actions on `get_image`, and
 * it left this one behind with a note that it ENQUEUES a render and so belongs
 * to the generation family — which is this slice. The module now holds exactly
 * that handler, and `registerAssetTools` is gone.
 *
 * Same AssetRegistry lookup, the same not-found error text, the same
 * applyOverrides + enqueue — including #865's `preserve_seed_inputs`, so an
 * override like `{ seed: 42 }` still survives while the other seeds
 * re-randomize — and the same JSON payload. It stays here rather than moving
 * into generate-image.ts because the asset registry is this module's concern;
 * the dispatcher imports it. The try/catch moved OUT to that dispatcher, which
 * applies the identical `errorToToolResult` — including for the not-found case,
 * which was already an errorToToolResult RETURN and is now a throw of the same
 * Error carrying the same message.
 *
 * PixelForge addition (not upstream's): a locally-registered asset (e.g.
 * pixelate_image output, via AssetRegistry.registerLocal) has no real ComfyUI
 * job behind it — `record.workflow` is `{}`. Upstream's own fold never had this
 * case (it has no local-registration path) and would otherwise enqueue an empty
 * workflow here; reject it before reaching enqueueWorkflow.
