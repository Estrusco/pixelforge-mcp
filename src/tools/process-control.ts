/**
 * The three ComfyUI process-lifecycle tools collapsed into one
 * action-parameterized `restart_comfyui` tool (0.50.0 surface consolidation,
 * slice 7).
 *
 * SHAPE: a FLAT object with an `action` enum — deliberately NOT a
 * z.discriminatedUnion, which the MCP SDK renders as a schema with ZERO visible
 * parameters, hiding every input from the model.
 *
 * REQUIREDNESS: all three retired tools took NO parameters at all, so `action`
 * is not merely the only schema-required field, it is the only field. There is
 * consequently no per-action presence guard to write here — the handler's only
 * job is to dispatch. Each branch calls the same service function the old tool
 * called, with the same (empty) arguments, and returns the identical content
 * block: the service result as pretty-printed JSON.

This is the normal way to reload newly installed custom nodes, and the escalation when queue (action:"cancel") reports a job WEDGED.\n' +
