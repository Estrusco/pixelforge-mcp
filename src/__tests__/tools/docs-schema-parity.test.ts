/**
 * The published Tool Reference must describe the schema a CLIENT is actually given.
 *
 * scripts/gen-tool-docs.ts converts each zod shape itself rather than reading the
 * real `tools/list` output, so its conversion options have to match the SDK's. They
 * did not: the SDK passes `io: 'input'`
 * (sdk/server/zod-json-schema-compat.js) and the generator passed nothing, which
 * means OUTPUT semantics — where a field with `.default()` is always present and so
 * counts as required.
 *
 * The result was 25 parameters across 18 tools documented as REQUIRED while the real
 * schema said optional (`comfy_cli.detail` is declared
 * `.optional().default("env")` and rendered `required default="env"`). A human
 * supplying every "required" field does needless work; a model reading it may refuse
 * to call the tool at all. And the docs-freshness gate stayed green the whole time,
 * because regenerating reproduced the same wrong answer — a generated artefact is
 * only as trustworthy as its agreement with the thing it claims to describe.
 *
 * This asserts that agreement directly, so the two can never drift apart again.
