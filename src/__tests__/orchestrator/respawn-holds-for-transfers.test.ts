// #1567 item 2 — a QUEUED credential respawn WAITS for in-flight transfers instead of
// killing them.
//
// The first half of #1567 shipped in 0.51.49: the at-risk snapshot is re-taken when the
// respawn fires, so the nine downloads it destroys are at least NAMED. That is a better
// obituary, not a fix — the reporter still loses ~48 GB and still has to issue nine cancels
// and nine re-issues. The reporter's own argument is the fix: a respawn that has already
// waited turns is by definition not urgent, and for a comfyui credential the running tools
// re-read the value from disk at use time, so the rebuild is a tidy-up. The transfers cost
// hours. So the respawn yields to them.
//
// What these pin, in order of what would silently un-ship the fix:
//   * the hold actually happens on the reporter's timeline (save with nothing in flight,
//     downloads started later, respawn comes due);
//   * something WAKES it — `applyPendingRestarts` runs at turn-done, and a user watching a
//     download is idle, so without the poll the respawn would simply never fire;
//   * it waits on PROGRESS, not on a clock, so a healthy 48 GB transfer is never killed for
//     being long and a dead one cannot pin the respawn for the rest of the session;
//   * only a CREDENTIAL respawn may wait — a retarget must not.
