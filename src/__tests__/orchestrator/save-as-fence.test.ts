// #1045 — a SAVE-AS wedges the session exactly like #932's panel_new_workflow did.
//
// A reporter built ~40 nodes, ran them, then called
// panel_save_workflow({name:"godot_titlescreen_video"}). The save SUCCEEDED
// ({saved:true, saved_as:true, copied_from:..., original_on_disk:true}) — and the
// very next panel_run failed with `workflow instance mismatch`, with the fence
// still naming the pre-save instance. The session was unusable immediately after
// a successful save of all that work.
//
// Cause is #932's, at a path I closed for workflow_new and missed here: a Save-As
// re-points the ACTIVE workflow (the canvas is now the new file, with its own
// identity) while the session's command fence still names the old one. Both
// commands re-point the active workflow, so both have to re-anchor.
//
// A plain in-place save is covered too. Its identity normally follows the
// workflow across the save, so the refresh re-derives the same value — but
// "normally" is precisely what failed here.
