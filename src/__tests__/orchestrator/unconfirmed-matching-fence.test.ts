// #1473 — right after a ComfyUI restart, `panel_set_workflow_target({mode:"current"})`
// returned isError:true saying the graph binding was NOT restored… and the reporter's very
// next `panel_graph_outline` succeeded with the expected graph. The session was never
// wedged; it was told it was.
//
// #1401 had already got the MESSAGE right for this shape: when the panel's reported identity
// MATCHES the fence the session already holds, it says so, says it is not a claim that graph
// tools work, and tells the caller to settle it with a graph read. #1473 took that read
// itself and put the answer in the reply. What was left (panel#980) is the VERDICT: when the
// settling read is ACCEPTED and the write-capability probe also says edits are allowed,
// "did NOT restore the graph binding" is a false negative — so that one shape now reports
// BOUND, on exactly the gate #1473's discussion scoped.
//
// Narrow by design: the probe runs only on the matching-uuid path, where the two remaining
// possibilities (a reconciliation race vs a stale/background record) are indistinguishable
// by inspection and trivially distinguishable by asking.
