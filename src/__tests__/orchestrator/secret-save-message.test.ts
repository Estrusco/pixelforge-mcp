//   "Token saved for the built-in comfyui tools (env "CIVITAI_API_TOKEN").
//    It's being applied now — the comfyui tools respawn with it as soon as this
//    turn ends, then I'll retry. No reload needed."
//
// for every save, regardless of whether anything persisted or anything ever
// respawned. An agent following that answer retries, gets the identical 401, and
// loops — with nothing distinguishing "no token configured" from "valid token on
// disk that the tools cannot see".
//
// These tests pin the replacement text against the receipt it is built from. They
// assert the REASON, not merely that some string came back: an unverified save
// must not read as verified, an unreported respawn must not read as a scheduled
// one, and a save proven NOT to have landed must be a refusal that tells the
// caller not to retry.
