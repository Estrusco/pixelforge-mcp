// #568 Defect 2 — an interrupt STORM must not starve the turn-gate release
// fallback. When the SDK is wedged (an interrupt produces NO terminal result), the
// gate is held by the aborted turn and only the bounded fallback can force it open.
// The OLD fallback did clearTimeout + re-arm on EVERY interrupt, so a stream of
// "send now" landing closer together than the window kept cancelling the pending
// net before it could fire — the gate stayed shut and NO turn ever started again
// ("Interrupted." with PENDING messages nothing flushes). The fix coalesces
// (keeps the earliest deadline) so the net set by the FIRST interrupt of a burst is
// an absolute ceiling, and fires on the live gate condition.

// Shrink the window so the test is fast. Read at module import, so set it BEFORE
// the dynamic import below.
