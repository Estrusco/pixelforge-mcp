// #1624 — A REPOSITORY THAT CANNOT BE INSTALLED BY ITS OWN NAME IS REFUSED, NOT SWAPPED.
//
// #1619 refuses the from-source install when the BARE NAME is contested across the six
// channel lists. This is the same substitution reached without any contest, and the
// mechanism is re-read at ComfyUI-Manager 4.2.2's own source
// (comfyui_manager/glob/manager_core.py at tag 4.2.2 — NOT `main`, which is the 3.41
// line and has no CNR fallback at all):
//
//   get_custom_nodes  cnr = self.get_cnr_by_repo(v['files'][0])
//                     if cnr: v['id'] = cnr['id']; node_id = v['id']
//                     else:   node_id = v['files'][0].split('/')[-1]
//   install_by_id     the_node = custom_nodes.get(node_id)          # NormalizedKeyDict
//                     if the_node is None and version_spec == 'nightly':
//                         cnr_fallback = self.cnr_map.get(node_id)
//                         repo_url = cnr_fallback['repository']     # someone ELSE's repo
//
// So a repository registered under an id that is not its own bare name is filed under
// that id, and a lookup for its name cannot return it from ANY channel. What answers
// instead is another channel entry that was not re-keyed, or the registry pack whose id
// IS that name. Either way the caller gets code they did not ask for, reported as a
// success.
//
// ## What was measured, replaying that resolution over the six channel lists plus the
// ## whole Comfy Registry (5117 repositories)
//
//   * 1366 repositories are re-keyed;
//   * 1268 of those resolve to NOTHING — Manager answers "not found", installs nobody's
//     code, and they are deliberately NOT recorded, because turning a clean failure into
//     a refusal is not this bug;
//   * 98 resolve to a DIFFERENT repository, 84 of them on the channel this code defaults
//     to. 56 are invisible to #1619's contested-name table, which is the gap this closes.
//
// ## What this deliberately does not cover
//
// The table is keyed by the CALLER'S repository, so it fires only for repositories the
// registry knows. An unregistered, unlisted fork named `ComfyUI-GGUF` hits exactly the
// same substitution and is not in here — that set is not enumerable from any snapshot.
// Those keep today's behaviour and the standing dispatch note.
