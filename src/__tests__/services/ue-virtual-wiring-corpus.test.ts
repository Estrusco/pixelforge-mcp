// SHARED ADVERSARIAL CORPUS — one table of virtual-wiring graph shapes, run
// against BOTH tools that resolve them:
//
//   • get_workflow (action:"strip") / panel_strip_workflow  → convertUiToApi
//   • panel_flatten_workflow                 → flattenUiWorkflow
//
// The two keep SEPARATE implementations of the same policy on purpose: they walk
// different link representations, and their invariants genuinely differ — the
// converter may DROP a connection (its output is a fresh executable graph), while
// the flattener edits the user's graph in place and may only DECLINE TO ADD. A
// shared helper serving both would need a mode flag on every decision, and a
// safety check parameterised by "am I allowed to delete" is subtly wrong for at
// least one caller.
//
// Duplicated implementations are not what makes this defect family recur —
// DIVERGENCE is. So the coupling lives here instead: same inputs, both tools,
// per-tool expectations stated separately wherever they legitimately differ. When
// the next cg-use-everywhere class or record shape shows up, it is added once and
// both tools are immediately held to it.
//
// Each case states the OBSERVABLE outcome — which consumer input ends up fed by
// which producer, which nodes survive, and what the caller is told — never how
// either tool got there.
