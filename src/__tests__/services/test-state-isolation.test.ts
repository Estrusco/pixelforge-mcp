// The property-level fix for "the suite keeps writing the developer's real
// ~/.comfyui-mcp" (#879, #866): a run-wide HOME redirect, plus write-guards
// that refuse any state write deliberately pointed back at the real home.
//
// The first group pins the REDIRECT itself: if the setup file is dropped from
// vitest.config.ts, every other isolation mechanism silently loses its
// foundation, so the suite must say so. The rest pin the guard's behaviour at
// the write, including the empty-redirect fold that made #866's NUL sentinel
// silently harmless.
