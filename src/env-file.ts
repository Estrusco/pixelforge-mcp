// decides where it lives — shared by config.ts (which loads it at boot) and
// services/panel-secrets.ts (which WRITES it when the panel collects a token).
//
// Why this module exists (issue #826): the orchestrator writes a panel-collected
// credential here and then relies on RESPAWNING the comfyui MCP child so the new
// value reaches it through the child's spawn env. That made every credential
// structurally dependent on a respawn always firing — and when it didn't, the
// token sat on disk, valid and 0600, while every download kept failing 401 with
// nothing distinguishing "no token configured" from "token present but never
// injected". `freshSecretValue()` removes that dependency: a credential is
// resolved from the canonical file at ACCESS time, so a long-lived child sees a
// token saved after it started.
//
// SECURITY: nothing here ever logs a value. Callers get the value or `undefined`;
// `secretKeyPresent()` exists so status can be reported without handling one.
